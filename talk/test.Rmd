### Slide 1

I wandered through http://www.r-project.org.

To state the good I found there, I'll also say what else I saw.

Having abandoned the true way, I fell into a deep sleep and awoke in a deep dark wood. I set out to escape the wood, but my path was blocked by a lion. As I fled to lower ground, a figure appeared before me. Have mercy on me, whatever you are," I cried, "whether shade or living human."
