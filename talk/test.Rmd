\note{\tiny{This chart is a guestimate of jobs advertised for R versus the proprietary industry standard, SAS.  I won't read too much into this, except to point out that SAS has been having a tough couple of years, whereas R has never had it better.  It's surprising that SAS is trending down, given that the last couple of years has seen the rise of terms like "big data" and "data science" in the business world.  "Data science" is a fancy term for data analysis with connotations of doing the analysis better than we usually do.  "Big data" refers to, surprisingly, very large amounts of data, usually sales data or website clicks data---much larger datasets than the Police uses.  Now, SAS salespeople tend to claim that R can't handle big data, whereas SAS can.  If that were the case, you'd think that SAS would be doing really well now that big data is fashionable and available.  And you'd expect that R wouldn't be making any gains.}}

\note{\tiny{Out of interest, I've included SPSS as well.  That's the package that Nils is interested in, and it's one of the main proprietary competitors of SAS.}}
