You can see in the first slide that eight oranges were eaten during the first hour of both days of the weekend.  In the second slide you can see that these have been added up.  People say R is hard, but I disagree.  The equivalent in Excel would either be screeds of formulae to cover every possible option, or a pivot table, and we know what a pain it is to maintain pivots.
